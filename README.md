Day 29 Project : PassWord Manager App with GUI et tkinter

The code made is in the password-manager-start folder.

The project is really cool and fun to make and very usefull.
The goal is to make a local password manager, user have to enter the website, the email, and the password associate to the website.

Once he click on add, it add the save information into a txt file.
Also if user don't already have a password he can generate a random password by pressing the so called button.
The random password, is then copied and user jus have to paste it into the website where is create an account.

To make it, we have to manipulate tkinter module to create a good lookin GUI and also the functionnality was pretty fun to make like the random password generator function and the ssaving function.
